## A Wordle Clone
It's a fun project to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It's an Indonesian version of Wordle where the user have to guess an Indonesian word instead. This project helps me to understand how JavaScript, HTML and CSS connect to each other.
### How It Works
- There will be a chosen word from the word list
- The user have 6 chance to guess the chosen word
- Failed to guess will result in game over
